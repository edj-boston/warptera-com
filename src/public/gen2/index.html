<div><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+CrazyLobber"><img src="img/CrazyLobber.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="CrazyLobber by warptera

This is my very first model, and it looks the part.  I obviously had no idea how to control muscle amplitude or timing, just look how messy the wave pallet is. And I don't even like lobster.  Well, at least it shows that anyone can learn to construct."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+InnocentRock"><img src="img/InnocentRock.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="InnocentRock by warptera

Continuing the 'crustacean' theme, my second model features a decently structured eel attacking a shrimp.  It also starts from an artificially created initial state.  That's why it appears to jump out when it starts."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Evil_With_a_Capital_E"><img src="img/Evil_With_a_Capital_E.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Evil_With_a_Capital_E by warptera

After reading the official tips from sodaplay, I managed to make these shapes oscillate back and forth.  A simple 'hear no evil...' theme rounded out the image, although I don't think I was trying to say anything in particular.  At this point I was just hoping to make something interesting enough to get in the zoo."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Hermeneutic_Circle"><img src="img/Hermeneutic_Circle.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Hermeneutic_Circle by warptera

I wish I had been more skilled when I tried to visually represent section 32 "Understanding & Interpretation" from Martin Heidegger's "Being & Time."  If you are familiar with that book, the theme is pretty straightforward.  Ironically, my desire to revisit and remake this model speaks volumes about its subject matter."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+UnblinkingHypnotronicEye"><img src="img/UnblinkingHypnotronicEye.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="UnblinkingHypnotronicEye by warptera

I scavenged the ring structures used here from an earlier zoo model and converted them to a zero-k piece.  Since then I have learned more about the soda community conventions and wish could remember the original maker to credit them."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+FullyIndependantSuspension"><img src="img/FullyIndependantSuspension.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="FullyIndependantSuspension by warptera

This is my first real model.  I had obviously learned how to make rotors and employed them in a frame that resembles a mountain or dirt bike.  I didn't really understand the physical settings yet, but the durability of the structure makes up for it."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Linear_Motor_but_Rotary_Motion"><img src="img/Linear_Motor_but_Rotary_Motion.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Linear_Motor_but_Rotary_Motion by warptera

This was my first entry into qwerty's legendary motor contest.  It is my first motored model and I later found out that lonelyswedish's first used a similar mechanism to power its wheels with a linear motor."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+WedgeWalker"><img src="img/WedgeWalker.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="WedgeWalker by warptera

This is my first motored walker and also appeared in qwerty's motor contest thread.  It is surprisingly delicate, so I consider myself lucky to have tuned it successfully.  Notice that the wheels are not perfectly round because I had not learned about flex structures yet."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Crescent_Elipsicron"><img src="img/Crescent_Elipsicron.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Crescent_Elipsicron by warptera

This is an attempt to revisit the structure used in Hermeneutic_Circle.  I think a Kevino model named pFloxZs inspired the cross-members."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+TwelveStrand"><img src="img/TwelveStrand.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="TwelveStrand by warptera

Strangely, my first regular walker came after my first motored walker.  I also remember paying close attention to tension springs for the first time when I made this model.  Originally it had six separate legs but I joined the toes with springs across the bottom.  The name refers to the number of muscles."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Harmonic_Fluteworm"><img src="img/Harmonic_Fluteworm.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Harmonic_Fluteworm by warptera

This is my first snake model.  The name is partially derived from the fact that one wave coursing through this model has twice the frequency of the other.  The amount of muscles and the timing complexity made this my first programming challenge."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Armadillicus"><img src="img/Armadillicus.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Armadillicus by warptera

This model was my first to get any attention from the rest of the community.  It uses some 2pt compound linear motors to give it the appearance of an exoskeleton.  And I am still surprised by how dramatic the motion turned out to be.  The name is meant to sound like a gladiator's."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Z_Axis"><img src="img/Z_Axis.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Z_Axis by warptera

This walker shuns direct muscling in favor of a strictly mechanical way of driving its legs.  I am not sure if this method was used before in the zoo, but I have used what has come to be called offset timing many times since."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Approaching_Theta"><img src="img/Approaching_Theta.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Approaching_Theta by warptera

This flexible structure reminds me of a scene from the movie Pi involving spirals.  The name derives from the discussion of the Fibonacci sequence and golden ratio in that scene.  I scavenged this structure many times for other models to avoid building another flex loop."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Veil_of_Being"><img src="img/Veil_of_Being.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Veil_of_Being by warptera

This has an eerie shape that looks like it's flapping in the air.  Maybe this would make a good screensaver?  The pretentious name is not meant to imply anything specific."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Cobra_Pharoah"><img src="img/Cobra_Pharoah.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Cobra_Pharoah by warptera

Sometimes it looks like a striking cobra, other times it looks like a pharaoh's headdress.  Either way it is just a reprogrammed version of Veil_of_Being."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+BlueCube_KevinoStyle"><img src="img/BlueCube_KevinoStyle.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="BlueCube_KevinoStyle by warptera

Resulting from my fascination with Kevino's Triangle_Q, this model was built by adding to his original.  I choose a color for the name because I knew I was going to make a series.  Since then I learned that adjusting the supports' relative amplitude can sharpen the square's shape."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Form_vs_Function"><img src="img/Form_vs_Function.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Form_vs_Function by warptera

I think I scavenged this shape from my earlier model UnblinkingHypnotronicEye.  I gave it a simple program and basically momentum does the rest.  The left over masses are there to highlight the circle's original dimensions."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Calle_Lily"><img src="img/Calle_Lily.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Calle_Lily by warptera

There is nothing really grim about this model, but it briefly takes on the appearance of a flower often seen at funeral services.  It was made by adding to Cobra_Pharaoh."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Golden_Mobius"><img src="img/Golden_Mobius.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Golden_Mobius by warptera

I made this model in response to a suggestion on the boards that someone make a Mobius strip.  I built it from Approaching_Theta and called it Golden_Mobius in reference to the golden ratio's inspiration of the former."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Q_Axis"><img src="img/Q_Axis.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Q_Axis by warptera

Named in reference to Z_Axis, this model used a similar mechanism but has very different dimensions.  It is similar to Ligament and submitted at the same time so I was surprised to see both models get in the zoo."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Ligament"><img src="img/Ligament.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Ligament by warptera

This model's joints remind me of ligaments.  It was submitted with a similar model named Q_Axis.  Both use the offset timing method from Z_Axis."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Radiance"><img src="img/Radiance.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Radiance by warptera

Radiance was only the second of my models to provoke acclaim from the community and even earned a kind word from our usually silent zookeeper.  The 3-day construction process was tedious because I had to constantly rebuild the legs to experiment.  It is a little too large but its legs radiate out nicely from the center."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Segmental"><img src="img/Segmental.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Segmental by warptera

I love how this model appears to consume itself as it slithers along.  At the time I was just learning to program flex structures so every result was a surprise.  This was a good one."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Slithering_Bubbles"><img src="img/Slithering_Bubbles.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Slithering_Bubbles by warptera

This is the same structure as Segmental programmed differently.  I wanted to achieve an effect like when a mass of pressurized water shoots through a hose in a cartoon."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Nifty_Little_Guy"><img src="img/Nifty_Little_Guy.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Nifty_Little_Guy by warptera

This configuration resulted from experimenting with different programming for a triangle structure.  It can be made into a nice linear motor combination, but this way is a little like a turbine.  It is the only time I have rushed naming a model and now it seems a little out of character."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Curvsive"><img src="img/Curvsive.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Curvsive by warptera

This model is the same structure as Segmental and Slithering_Bubbles with a different program.  It reminds me of cursive handwriting with a calligraphy pen."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+PurpleHexagon_KevinoStyle"><img src="img/PurpleHexagon_KevinoStyle.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="PurpleHexagon_KevinoStyle by warptera

This model has the dubious distinction of being the most often poached in the zoo.  Surprisingly, many people like to twist it into odd shapes and resubmit it.  It can even look like Kevino's original TriangleQ when tangled up, although I don't condone it."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Panzer_Amoeba"><img src="img/Panzer_Amoeba.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Panzer_Amoeba by warptera

This model is really just a simple amoeba but it employs what I learned from Kevino's TriangleQ.  The supports are programmed to distort the overall shape.  I felt it looked like the design of some old German Panzer tanks."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Cold_Fusion"><img src="img/Cold_Fusion.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Cold_Fusion by warptera

Coaldiamond posted a motor in the zoo that was a 3pt version of what we now call a Counter Rotor.  He wondered aloud if it could be used to power a walker and Jeckyll and I both figured out ways to do it (though I prefer his way).  The first part of the name is meant to recall the beginning of sound in Coaldiamond's name."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Medium_Panzer"><img src="img/Medium_Panzer.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Medium_Panzer by warptera

When I tried applying the same technique I used in Panzer_Amoeba to a larger shape I saw that the distortion was more defined.  I did a very conscientious job of tuning and was happy to see such a subtle modification get into the zoo."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Chasing_the_Wrinkle"><img src="img/Chasing_the_Wrinkle.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Chasing_the_Wrinkle by warptera

Coming up upon this model I was more and more point density in my flex chains.  I went a little overboard here and have backed off every since.  Nevertheless, the high-speed extension and compression of this structure causes it to get ahead of itself, creating the interesting wrinkle effect."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Simplification"><img src="img/Simplification.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Simplification by warptera

When I make a series of increasingly complex models, I always burn out.  Hence you will often see an exceedingly simple model such as this one following them.  This is the first time it happened so it earned the obvious name.  It is probably also my fastest walker and might be a decent soda racer with a little tuning."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Pontoon"><img src="img/Pontoon.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Pontoon by warptera

This is essentially the same model as Medium_Panzer, but with a different program.  The supports are programmed to increase with the part of the flex chain they attach to so it creating this elongated amoeba structure.  I felt it looked like a pontoon used on some of the boats seen on a lake I frequent in the summers."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+JellyBean"><img src="img/JellyBean.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="JellyBean by warptera

While Medium_Panzer had its supports out of phase with its flex chain and Pontoon's where in phase, JellyBean's are 1/4 phase apart.  It created a strange shape that I tuned to look like it was partially suspended as it rolled.  I submitted a zero-g version but of course it was rejected for being too similar."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Gemini_Twins"><img src="img/Gemini_Twins.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Gemini_Twins by warptera

This is actually two separate but identical structures.  I experimented with different arrangements but settled on having one perpendicular to the other.  They are basically similar to Approaching_Theta but they each have two waves running their flex loops instead of one."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Organelle"><img src="img/Organelle.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Organelle by warptera

Organelle uses three of the same structure that Gemini_Twins used.  The main difference is that they have some masses in common and so intertwine when they move."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Propelled"><img src="img/Propelled.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Propelled by warptera

Propelled is the same structure as Organelle except the loops are untangled.  Unfortunately though, they both share the same mistake.  One of the loops is connected one mass off.  It doesn't make a whole lot of difference in terms of the finished model, but it bugs me and I wish I had caught it."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Radiate"><img src="img/Radiate.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Radiate by warptera

Here I tried to revisit the same motors and basic principles at work in Radiance.  The result is a little out of proportion however and much less majestic.  The name indicates the lineage but is appropriately lackluster."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Schadenfreude"><img src="img/Schadenfreude.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Schadenfreude by warptera

This is based on Radiate and is one of only two or three of my models that I just don't like.  Firstly, the structure seems almost crippled.  And secondly, the leg braces bend each motor out of shape.  The name means 'shameful joy' in German but there is no joy here."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Upright_Barrow"><img src="img/Upright_Barrow.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Upright_Barrow by warptera

This model really has its own look.  I intentionally set out to make a combination walker that rolled as well, but I didn't intend it to be so upright.  I enjoyed the result, however, so I included that part in the name that is a modification of the everyday wheelbarrow."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Y_Rune"><img src="img/Y_Rune.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Y_Rune by warptera

This structure is a circular version of the one used in Segmental, Slithering_Bubbles, and Cursive.  And like those models, here I was experimenting with different flex programming.  This result looked like the letter Y and I guess I called it a rune because I was reading Tolkien at the time."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+SlitheRing"><img src="img/SlitheRing.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="SlitheRing by warptera

SlitheRing uses the same structure as Y_Rune programmed like my Slithering_Bubbles.  I had envisioned something a little nobler and I think I could tune it much better today.  I am usually very careful with my punctuation so you can tell that the capital R in the name is not a mistake, it implies both it's lineage and its structure."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Convolution"><img src="img/Convolution.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Convolution by warptera

Unless I'm mistaken this is the only model I have kept which was rejected from the zoo.  It is a reprogrammed version of Y_Rune and SlitheRing, so I can't blame ed for nixing it, but I liked the result anyway so I kept it."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+TwinkleTwinkle"><img src="img/TwinkleTwinkle.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="TwinkleTwinkle by warptera

I can't remember what this model was supposed to be, but I do remember that the current form resulted in a mistake.  I deleted the wrong set of supports and my work coiled up and disappeared."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Pneumatic_Triangle"><img src="img/Pneumatic_Triangle.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Pneumatic_Triangle by warptera

This model makes use of the giant flex ring from Y_Rune and adds TriangleQ type supports to the center.  I named it so because I felt the effect looked like an inflatable tire.  It's difficult to be certain but this is probably my largest model.  It is certainly too big for the constructor window."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+ExternalTwirl"><img src="img/ExternalTwirl.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="ExternalTwirl by warptera

This model resulted from a rather complex experiment that I ended up deleting most of.  The result moved on its own in a way I hadn't intended but I liked it and thought it was original so I submitted it.  I tuned it so that it made part of a rotation every step it takes."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Twelve_Motor_Stability"><img src="img/Twelve_Motor_Stability.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Twelve_Motor_Stability by warptera

If you make a linear motor from any given guideline, try taking that guideline and find the hypotenuse of a right triangle made from it.  If you make a motor with lengths equal to the hypotenuse, the two motor sizes can be fitted to make a square with diagonals like in this model."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Inimitable_Resolve"><img src="img/Inimitable_Resolve.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Inimitable_Resolve by warptera

This is basically the same type of model as Cold_Fusion, but uses a 4pt CR.  The mechanism is a little more refined but I don't like the overall dimensions.  The name is a phrase I recall hearing a lot in the aftermath of 9/11."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+CloverStar"><img src="img/CloverStar.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="CloverStar by warptera

These are the same flex loops used in many of my early models.  I connected them are right angles on a whim and was surprised to see that the result looked great.  It spins slowly if you look closely."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+WarptMotor"><img src="img/WarptMotor.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="WarptMotor by warptera

I don't think I ever actually submitted this to the zoo, but it is a fine motor.  I have made several models with it and I've noticed that every once in a while someone finds it in my pub and uses it in a walker."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Quantum_Play"><img src="img/Quantum_Play.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Quantum_Play by warptera

This is the same structure as CloverStar, except I added another loop.  The intersections are at different places as well, forming a hexagon in the middle instead of a square.  The finished model looks nice because of how each loop overlaps with the two next to it."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Grey_Bubbles"><img src="img/Grey_Bubbles.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Grey_Bubbles by warptera

One day I thought it would be interesting to replace the single springs in a regular amoeba structure with small shapes that are somewhat complex themselves.  I was hoping it would roll but it looked better in zero-g.  Also, I thought the density of each circle made it look kind of gray."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Volvox"><img src="img/Volvox.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Volvox by warptera

This is a reprogrammed version of Grey_Bubbles that has one wave cycle instead of two.  I assumed that this would make it roll better and luckily I was right.  I had to be very careful when tuning it, though.  Because too much amplitude made it shrivel up requiring me to untangle it."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Hollow_Point"><img src="img/Hollow_Point.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Hollow_Point by warptera

This is the first result of my fascination with mono's old flex walkers.  It has 3 legs per side so the programming was kind of new for me.  The name comes from the fact that the legs are very pointy while the frame is hollow.  But because of the type of bullet it ends up sounding like the title of an action movie."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Gooey_Glider"><img src="img/Gooey_Glider.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Gooey_Glider by warptera

I had an alien in mind when I built this, and hopefully that's evident.  During construction I learned how difficult flex structures can be because every time you need to alter a distance you have to change the lengths of many springs instead of just one.  It was also a challenge to tune."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Ursa_Minor"><img src="img/Ursa_Minor.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Ursa_Minor by warptera

This model kept me up very late at night.  I wanted to submit it because I was very excited about it, but I didn't want to cut corners.  I struggled with the timing of the legs and if I had had more experience I might have chosen different but no seemed to complain."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+WhiteThorn"><img src="img/WhiteThorn.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="WhiteThorn by warptera

It is difficult if not impossible to follow a model like Ursa_Minor.  But for WhiteThorn I decided to stick with flex structures but use the rolling method of locomotion.  It took a while to decide exactly which muscles needed to be springs, and tuning was a pain, but I am happy with the result."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Triumvir"><img src="img/Triumvir.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Triumvir by warptera

This model is a bit like a turbine but if wave amplitude is reduced to zero you will see it doesn't rely on rigid shapes at each intersection.  It was actually formed from a combination of three smaller devices.  You can see how the fact that they share the zips springs in the middle forces those intersections apart more than the corners."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Vector_Array"><img src="img/Vector_Array.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Vector_Array by warptera

This model used my WarptMotor and I made it because I felt I had been working with flex too long.  I was becoming known for making things like mono used to and I wanted to show that I was fully capable of making regular motored walkers.  This desire also led to its sharp, un-flex like appearance."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+OrangePentagon_KevinoStyle"><img src="img/OrangePentagon_KevinoStyle.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="OrangePentagon_KevinoStyle by warptera

A constructor named Roey_Schurr asked me to teach him what I knew about flex structures like Kevino's TriangleQ.  Over the course of several emails I explained how to do it and I made this model to bridge the gap between my square and hexagon versions."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+ZebraStar"><img src="img/ZebraStar.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="ZebraStar by warptera

This used the same flex loop as OrangePentagon_KevinoStyle with 5 compression cycles running through it.  I wondered if a similar structure could be made with the loop in a star configuration and managed to find a pattern for the supports that seemed to work."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Shy_Star"><img src="img/Shy_Star.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Shy_Star by warptera

This uses the same principles as CloverStar and Quantum_Play but has five sides.  It is also made with a single continuous flex loop instead of multiple ones intersecting each other.  With wave amplitude at zero you can see I also left more open space in the middle.  I think this is the best one of the three."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Geometrix"><img src="img/Geometrix.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Geometrix by warptera

Again I tried to consciously get away from flex structures by making a more conventional model.  This continues the 5-sided paradigm of the previous models by moves kind of like a spiky amoeba."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Auto_Reverse"><img src="img/Auto_Reverse.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Auto_Reverse by warptera

I had hoped this model would be a large amoeba that looked like a cross-section of a tube rolling by turning itself inside out.  Unfortunately I ran into a problem where the flex structure needed half of the wave period that the supports needed.  As a result it distorts, but it was interesting how it turns itself around."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+DeepSea_Star"><img src="img/DeepSea_Star.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="DeepSea_Star by warptera

This model continued my recent fascination with 5 sided structures and programming.  It ended up being an incredible pain to tune.  It always wanted to collapse or do flips without moving forward.  I managed to get it moving reliably but play with the physical setting to see how delicate it is."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Pumpkin_Carriage"><img src="img/Pumpkin_Carriage.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Pumpkin_Carriage by warptera

At this time I figured out that by using a graduated guideline to vary the lengths I could turn a flex circle into an ellipse.  It wasn't really too practical for programming but it made a nice frame for this rotor powered roller."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+daintyflexer"><img src="img/daintyflexer.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="daintyflexer by warptera

This model took a very long time to make and tune, but I think it ended up being one of my best. The problem is that in order to appreciate it you must be familiar both with the community's habit of remaking the original daintywalker, and the difficulty in constructing viable soft walkers."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+HexNutt"><img src="img/HexNutt.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="HexNutt by warptera

This is very similar to my PurpleHexagon_KevinoStyle except it uses supports that span longer distances and overlap each other more.  It ended up looking like a hexagonal nut that fits on the end of a carriage bolt so I named it such."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Plutonium_Rover"><img src="img/Plutonium_Rover.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Plutonium_Rover by warptera

Since I'm interested in mechanical things, the idea of a vehicle that walks rather than rolls is inherently captivating.  I wish I had made some of the proportions different but I think it came out okay.  The flag on the back is meant to imply that this is perhaps a recreational transport."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Pyre"><img src="img/Pyre.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Pyre by warptera

Once again a very simple model follows a group of very complex ones.  But despite its simple structure I really like the way this model moves and looks.  The name derives from my impression that the top looks like a kindling flame on a torch."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Stuffed_Slug"><img src="img/Stuffed_Slug.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Stuffed_Slug by warptera

This model uses the same technique as Pumpkin_Carriage to produce and elliptical flex shape.  I was unsure how to program it but finally settled on the current method because I like the way it has too partially roll to move forward.  I felt this motion made it look as if it was a creature that had eaten too much."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Baby_Glider"><img src="img/Baby_Glider.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Baby_Glider by warptera

This is an obvious attempt to revisit Gooey_Glider.  I naturally added enlarged eyes, shortened proportions, and flailing arms to give the impression it was a juvenile of the same species but I think it ended up being too cutesy."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Desert_Mantis"><img src="img/Desert_Mantis.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Desert_Mantis by warptera

Around this time I realized that I had basically ignored regular un-motored walkers.  I decided to experiment with some linkage designs like I had seen Kevino and others use and this is the result.  I don't know why but I was thinking of a praying mantis when I made it, even though I didn't try to make it look like one."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Signature_Walker"><img src="img/Signature_Walker.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Signature_Walker by warptera

I purposely set out to make a motor in the shape of a W, and I think I had intended to do my whole name but those types of plans never pan out.  The motion is a little jerky but I managed to distinguish the letter shape from the rest of the mechanism pretty well so I think the result is effective."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Vector_Analysis"><img src="img/Vector_Analysis.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Vector_Analysis by warptera

This model uses my WarptMotor just like Vector_Array and started my tradition of naming models with similar power sources with the words 'array' and 'analysis.'  The legs are a different design and it required less amplitude, so I think it looks nice and was good practice for me."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Ampersand"><img src="img/Ampersand.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Ampersand by warptera

This is a model that I really like the look of.  It is kind of an expanded version of TriangleQ, but the separate shapes all reinforce each other without their own internal supports.  I have always liked both the symbol '&' and the name 'ampersand', which is a corruption of a clever Latin phrase."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Antler"><img src="img/Antler.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Antler by warptera

One thing I really like about how this model turned out is how the legs move up above the frame and back down again in the course of their stride.  I don't know why I picked the name I did.  But I remember thinking about how the word 'ambling,' sounded and is another word for 'walking.'"></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+A_Hangers"><img src="img/A_Hangers.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="A_Hangers by warptera

Both this model and A_Frames are models that some people really seemed to like, which surprised me.  I think it is a little funny to have the motor up in the air with all the legs on hinges hanging down below."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+A_Frames"><img src="img/A_Frames.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="A_Frames by warptera

The main challenge about making a model like this or A_Hangers is tuning.  It is not difficult to tune but you must make a decision about how the legs look when they swing forward.  These models can move surprisingly fast but look awkward when they do, so the motion is a subjective matter."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Fundamental_Ontology"><img src="img/Fundamental_Ontology.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Fundamental_Ontology by warptera

This walker came about as a complete accident.  I was halfway through working with a design that I wasn't sure would work when it became tangled.  Suddenly I realized that the result walked on its own anyway and looked better than what I had planned.  Hooray for serendipity!"></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Ontology"><img src="img/Ontology.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Ontology by warptera

This model is a more complex version of Fundamental_Ontology.  It uses flex circles for legs but the effect isn't quite what I desired.  Ontology is the study of being and is the focus of my college career."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Primordial"><img src="img/Primordial.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Primordial by warptera

I called this model Primordial because I had been working with very complex structures at the time and returning to rotors was a nice break.  I find it is always helpful to revisit old structures when I lack new ideas.  You can always find something new in what is old in my experience."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+CasCadence"><img src="img/CasCadence.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="CasCadence by warptera

This model looks complex but it really just has a lot of simple legs.  In fact, it is nearly the same as a daintywalker.  I originally wanted to call this model Cadence but someone had just recently taken that name.  So I combined by first choice with my second choice Cascade and came up with CasCadence."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Morning_Star"><img src="img/Morning_Star.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Morning_Star by warptera

This model uses daintywalker style legs arranged sideways.  In effect, this illustrates the relationship between rotors and simple legs.  Note that the way I joined the legs eliminated the need to connect the two chassis masses with a supporting spring.  The muscles keep them equidistant at all times."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Swept"><img src="img/Swept.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Swept by warptera

This model was part of a zoo update in which I had 9 models.  At first I didn't like it very much but it has since grown on me.  Its structure is related to that of Radiance and its family of walkers.  The main difference is that the legs are timed of opposite motors instead of the same motor."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Axis"><img src="img/Axis.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Axis by warptera

Axis revisits the offset timing I used way back in Z_Axis.  It is a nicely simplified mechanism and really illustrates how the principle works.  I have made similar models since and have learned to use motors that provide less displacement to make the motion more efficient."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+High_Tide"><img src="img/High_Tide.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="High_Tide by warptera

The motor used here is a rather attractive linear combination.  There are many possible configurations for these motors so they don't all deserve their own names.  The model rides quite high and it reminds me of the clam diggers that scour the beaches near me.  Of course, I didn't think Low_Tide was a particularly nice name."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Wriggle"><img src="img/Wriggle.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Wriggle by warptera

This is one of the first times I revisited snake type locomotion since I made Armadillicus.  It uses a scalloped flex structure that you can see better with wave amplitude set to zero.  I got the idea from a zoo model whose name and maker I forget."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Twist"><img src="img/Twist.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Twist by warptera

Mono has a model named twist37 that happens to be a turbine combination as well so I assume we both saw the structures the same way.  In any case I didn't know about his version until after I made mine.  All models of this type are quite good looking in my opinion."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Spinal"><img src="img/Spinal.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Spinal by warptera

This is a turbine but in the place of regular muscles are muscled tension springs. I tuned it so it is difficult to see what it going on in there, but look how each tension spring tends to flip as it gets very small toward the bottom-middle of the model."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Insectoid"><img src="img/Insectoid.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Insectoid by warptera

This is a three sided turbine combination that uses tension springs instead of regular muscles to create legs.  It walks in a disappointing fashion, but I like how the result looked like a pair of compound eyes like flies and other insects have."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Simplexium"><img src="img/Simplexium.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Simplexium by warptera

This is a simple three-point turbine with tension leg extensions.  This model really highlights the difficulty in classifying models.  Is it a very low walker, or is it a roller with extensions?  It is important to avoid getting caught up in such things."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Complexium"><img src="img/Complexium.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Complexium by warptera

This is a more complicated version of Simplexium.  It is actually a combination of three of those prior structures and I think the result blows the original away.  To me it looks like an undersea urchin or a living snowflake."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Tendons"><img src="img/Tendons.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Tendons by warptera

Although the structure is unrelated, I named this model with my Ligament in mind.  I like the idea of naming models after anatomical structures that serves similar purposes in animals that springs serve in models.  The programming of this model allows it to hop along with a nice gait."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Ridgeback"><img src="img/Ridgeback.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Ridgeback by warptera

Once I figured out for myself that you could replace the muscles in turbines with tension springs, I decided to try some more complicated structures.  This model uses a tensioned linkage in place of each normal muscle and looks like some kind of fierce creature."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Alpha_Turbine"><img src="img/Alpha_Turbine.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Alpha_Turbine by warptera

This model is named Alpha_Turbine because it uses a series of A frames to spin the flex circles.  There is nothing particularly special about it but it works very well so I am still proud of it."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Tumble_Stride"><img src="img/Tumble_Stride.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Tumble_Stride by warptera

This model is a uses a vertical turbine similar to the horizontal one in Alpha_Turbine.  What I didn't count on however is that the ends of the turbine tends to rotate in relation to one another depending on what permanent physical settings you choose.  This gives it an asymmetrical appearance but I still like the result."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Arsenic"><img src="img/Arsenic.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Arsenic by warptera

This model earned a particularly nasty name although I'm not exactly sure why.  It probably has something to do with its resemblance to the anarchy symbol.  It is basically the same design as Alpha_Turbine except the flex circles are at the ends of those horizontal extensions."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+TriScales"><img src="img/TriScales.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="TriScales by warptera

This is a model that I hoped would have turned out better.  I experimented for days with different programming techniques and I finally settled for the current version.  I wished the motion could have been more like Armadillicus."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+QuadriHelix_MonoStyle"><img src="img/QuadriHelix_MonoStyle.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="QuadriHelix_MonoStyle by warptera

This is my tribute to mono's triplehelix, one of my all-time favorites.  It took me a while to grasp the programming and once I did I had an even greater appreciation of how brilliant it is.  In fact I think his three-sided version looks a little better than my four-sided one."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+The_Making_of_Hyperion"><img src="img/The_Making_of_Hyperion.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="The_Making_of_Hyperion by warptera

This is one of the few models I know of its kind allowed in the zoo.  I took extra time with it to make sure that it offered more content than the original because I thought people would really be interested in seeing it."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Hyperion"><img src="img/Hyperion.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Hyperion by warptera

To make Hyperion I had to branch out from the knowledge I gained while working on QuadriHelix_MonoStyle significantly.  From the beginning I knew it would be a great looking model so I gave it a name I had been saving for a while.  It is the name of the titan who fathered Helios."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Saunter"><img src="img/Saunter.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Saunter by warptera

As usual, this simple model follows one of my great efforts.  I have found this to be a beneficial and rewarding exercise.  It also helps prevent burning out.  Getting the relative amplitude just right was tricky, but I like how the two masses at the top do not require being connected."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Translation"><img src="img/Translation.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Translation by warptera

This model revisits the method of rotary motion I used way back in the obliquely titled Linear_Motor_but_Rotary_Motion.  The mechanism is a little jerky but it is an intellectually interesting way of driving the wheels."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Alcibiades"><img src="img/Alcibiades.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Alcibiades by warptera

This is a structure similar to Kevino's TriangleQ except it uses tension springs instead of regular muscles.  The result is a very attractive spiky rolling amoeba.  I named it after an Athenian Statesman who led a particularly thorny and tumultuous career."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Flex_Effect"><img src="img/Flex_Effect.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Flex_Effect by warptera

I have always like simple zero-g models that do something interesting in their mechanism.  This model appears to morph into diamonds and squares from its default circle shape arrangement.  I stumbled upon the method while researching methods for my Thales model."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Beacon"><img src="img/Beacon.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Beacon by warptera

This is a set of bent flex structures arranged much the way Jeckyll and others arrange linear motors.  I thought this model was relatively plain, but Jeckyll saw something special in it and it launched a collaborative effort between us to explore this technology that was quite rewarding."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Amoeba_Walker"><img src="img/Amoeba_Walker.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Amoeba_Walker by warptera

Months before this model was made someone challenged the forum to power a walker with an amoeba.  No one did it including me until this idea suddenly struck me one day.  I whipped it up late at night and was really exited to have solved such a long-standing dilemma."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Elliptical_Amoeba"><img src="img/Elliptical_Amoeba.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Elliptical_Amoeba by warptera

Submitted with Amoeba_Walker this model showcases the technology behind the former.  By adding a second set of guts to a normal flex-rimmed amoeba I was able to keep the two center points equidistant at all times.  This allows the amoeba to be mounted in a frame to power the legs of a walker."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Three_Nodes"><img src="img/Three_Nodes.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Three_Nodes by warptera

This is another version of my new amoeba with three sets of guts inside it.  It is quite massive but some people still managed to power walkers with it."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+3pt_FlexMotor"><img src="img/3pt_FlexMotor.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="3pt_FlexMotor by warptera

This motor basically produces a linear combination type motor, but it has the appearance of a flex circle.  It is constructed a little differently though to make sure that the six mass positions are qui distant from each other."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+4pt_FlexMotor"><img src="img/4pt_FlexMotor.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="4pt_FlexMotor by warptera

This is simply a 4pt version of my 3pt flex motor.  It was actually a long time before I went back to implement these motors in a model.  But I am committed to using any motor that I submit to the zoo in a walker to show people that it is possible."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+5pt_CounterRotor"><img src="img/5pt_CounterRotor.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="5pt_CounterRotor by warptera

I'm not certain, but I think this might be the first time someone made a counter rotor greater than 3 or 4 sides.  I don't deserve any of the credit however, I just made the next logical progression from an idea that others made."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Gyroscopic_Star"><img src="img/Gyroscopic_Star.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Gyroscopic_Star by warptera

This was my first inertial model, but it was before we named this type such (unfortunately it's a misnomer for which I am partially responsible).  The real leap however was when Roey_Schurr and Lectvay both figured out independently how to power walkers inertially."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Amoeba_Strand_Motors"><img src="img/Amoeba_Strand_Motors.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Amoeba_Strand_Motors by warptera

These were some motors I supplied for my Amoeba Motor Contest thread in the sodaforum.  I made sure to construct them (as always) with the highest possible accuracy since many people would rely on them for their models."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Amoeba_Analysis"><img src="img/Amoeba_Analysis.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Amoeba_Analysis by warptera

This model continues my series of Analysis walkers, each of which explores a different motor or locomotion type.  It is actually quite similar to Amoeba_Walker but used two of my amoeba strand motors in the frame."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Ground_Clearance"><img src="img/Ground_Clearance.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Ground_Clearance by warptera

I like making models that use everyday structures in unusual ways.  This model has two elliptical amoebas arranged vertically.  The ability to create exact tension springs from experimentally measured lengths is what really makes this chassis possible."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Thales"><img src="img/Thales.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Thales by warptera

I intended this to be one of my better models.  But this design ended up having so many masses high up that it was difficult to tune effectively.  I also experimented with different programs for the legs but none of them moved exactly the way I wanted originally."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Dual_Traction"><img src="img/Dual_Traction.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Dual_Traction by warptera

This model takes advantage of the fact that linear motors complete one cycle for every two of most other motors.  So the amoebas at the end of each foot spin faster than the legs move. Ultimately. However, it was so complex that I could tune it to move faster without its roller skates."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Hazard"><img src="img/Hazard.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Hazard by warptera

This model is a triangle version of my Flex_Effect that used squares.  It reminded me of a flashing hazard sign that people set up on the side of the road."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Typhoon"><img src="img/Typhoon.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Typhoon by warptera

This is basically a hollow flex amoeba, but the spikes give it a more interesting appearance.  I wanted to call this model Hurricane because it looks like the symbols that weathermen use on their maps.  Luckily, I checked and found that name was taken so I changed it."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Iris"><img src="img/Iris.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Iris by warptera

The iris is probably my favorite complex mechanical device.  I have always loved iris shaped doors in science fiction movies.  This version actually turns itself inside out, making it impractical for actual construction, but it looks nice in the sodaconstructor."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Star_Pulsion"><img src="img/Star_Pulsion.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Star_Pulsion by warptera

This model illustrates the important relationship between counter rotors and axial rotor arrangements.  Those stars are actually 5pt CRs with one side of each motor zipped together.  Then the tension spring was fitted to link each inner ring while the outer ring provides the traction."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Circulation"><img src="img/Circulation.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Circulation by warptera

This model uses my 5pt counter rotor and is related to my Cold_Fusion and Inimitable_Resolve walkers.  The main difference is how those masts on the top, all of which radiate from a central point, support the legs."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Porcupine_Egg"><img src="img/Porcupine_Egg.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Porcupine_Egg by warptera

This amoeba is related to Typhoon but uses a different program.  Basically it looks like and egg.  A static flex ring can be shaped like an egg if you use a graduated guideline to make each length progressively shorter then longer, just like the muscles appear in this model at any given time."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Apollo"><img src="img/Apollo.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Apollo by warptera

Apollo is an 8pt counter rotor with tension spring extensions.  The effect is mesmerizing, especially if you look into the center of the motor.  The lines look like a kaleidoscope as the motor operates.  This is part of my series of Sun and other related models."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+8pt_Counter_Rotor"><img src="img/8pt_Counter_Rotor.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="8pt_Counter_Rotor by warptera

This is the base for my model Apollo.  It is a difficult motor to work with because no matter what you build around it, each mass already has seven springs attached.  This makes it prone to harmful vibrations."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Sunflower"><img src="img/Sunflower.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Sunflower by warptera

Unfortunately, the name Sunflower was already taken in the zoo, so this model made it in with the name Sunflower1.  Ever since that happened I have always checked for redundancy by pasting a zoo link to my desired name in a browser."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Amoeba_Double_Strand"><img src="img/Amoeba_Double_Strand.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Amoeba_Double_Strand by warptera

This was another motor I made available for my Amoeba Motor Contest Thread.  Ever since then it occasionally gets poached and turns up in the zoo as a rolling model.  It always disappoints me but at least I know that model are interested in looking through my model collection."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Ottoman"><img src="img/Ottoman.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Ottoman by warptera

This is a relatively simple example of how to power a walker with two identical rotary motors of any type.  Basically you just construct reinforced squares to the corresponding masses and tune it.  It's very easy."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Surveyor"><img src="img/Surveyor.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Surveyor by warptera

This is a funny biped that uses my Amoeba_Double_Strand motor.  I had to adjust the amount of lean so that it could balance itself many times.  I often like the appearance of asymmetrical walkers because you don't see them that often."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Digital_Star"><img src="img/Digital_Star.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Digital_Star by warptera

This uses the same structure as Typhoon and Porcupine_Egg but is programmed like my BlueCube_KevinoStyle.  I had planned to make a series of 'digital' models but somehow I never got around to it."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Soft_Shell"><img src="img/Soft_Shell.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Soft_Shell by warptera

This model reminds me of the anatomy of a horseshoe crab.  If you have never heard of them, they are ancient and interesting animals.  I really like how this simple model turned out."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Hard_Shell"><img src="img/Hard_Shell.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Hard_Shell by warptera

This model is really unrelated to Soft_Shell but I thought it would be fun to give them opposing names.  Creative model naming and placement is one of the things that can help get your models into the zoo."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Valence"><img src="img/Valence.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Valence by warptera

This is just a simple counter rotor arrangement, but I like how it turned out.  Some how it reminds me of the valence shells in the quantum theory of the electron.  I had tuned it as a jumping model, but I like it better in zero-g."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Factor_Four"><img src="img/Factor_Four.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Factor_Four by warptera

This model shows how easy it can be to take advantage of the relatively stationary points in counter rotors. This seems to trick most constructors, but hopefully they get the idea by looking at this example."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Pyramidal"><img src="img/Pyramidal.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Pyramidal by warptera

A close relative of Hard_Shell, this model is like a stack of simple daintywalker style legs.  There is nothing too difficult about constructing this type of walker so I am surprised that they don't appear in the zoo more often."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Phased_Array"><img src="img/Phased_Array.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Phased_Array by warptera

This model is the first result from my collaboration with Jeckyll on bent flex chain combinations.  It uses some really neat phased supports to prevent the delicate flex combination from collapsing while it's in the weakest part of its motion.  It is a bit like Ampersand in principle."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Triax"><img src="img/Triax.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Triax by warptera

Triax uses three of the flex combinations used in Phased_Array.  But each unit is maintained by radially phased supports and then connected to the other structures by the center point.  It is awfully slow but the mechanism is still impressive."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Guideline_Contest_Mascots"><img src="img/Guideline_Contest_Mascots.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Guideline_Contest_Mascots by warptera

These models were made to show people how easy it was to make a model according to the rules of my guideline contest thread.  I particularly like the idea of the walker that bridges the other smaller walker."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Inertial_A_Frames"><img src="img/Inertial_A_Frames.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Inertial_A_Frames by warptera

This model is related to my other A Frame models but moves by inertia propulsion.  It is relatively straight forward if you understand the principle at work."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Parallax"><img src="img/Parallax.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Parallax by warptera

This model used one master guideline to create the lengths and tension springs necessary for its equilateral triangle theme.  The character of the model changes dramatically when the wave amplitude is altered.  Over all I think it should have been smaller to fit in the constructor window better."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Hexal"><img src="img/Hexal.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Hexal by warptera

Hexal was an incredible pain to construct and even worse to program.  I had to pin it all stretched out with fixed masses just to select individual springs.  On neat thing you can do with it is to delete masses and attempt to create a symmetrical snowflake pattern."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Synthesis"><img src="img/Synthesis.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Synthesis by warptera

I named this model Synthesis because it combined a linear motor arrangement by Jeckyll with the inertial theories put forward by Roey_Schurr and Lectvay.  Essentially it has the same design as Sunflower, and could also be adapted for any appropriate rotary motor."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Linear_Wedge_Motor"><img src="img/Linear_Wedge_Motor.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Linear_Wedge_Motor by warptera

This motor produces a very simple rotary pattern in its power points, but it is really a triumph of actuator programming.  Almost every spring in its structure is phased to keep the whole thing running smoothly and looking like a triangle."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Keystone"><img src="img/Keystone.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Keystone by warptera

This is a simple implementation of my Linear_Wedge_Motor using short tension springs and leg extensions.  The word keystone is the name for a uniquely shaped block that fits into the top of a stone archway.  I thought my motor was vaguely reminiscent of that shape."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Touchstone"><img src="img/Touchstone.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Touchstone by warptera

This is another model using my Linear_Wedge_Motor. it is basically the same as Keystone so its name is derivative, but its proportions are much larger and it uses a lower pivot point for the leg braces."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Logos"><img src="img/Logos.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Logos by warptera

Logos uses a much more complicated motor than the similar Linear_Wedge_Motor but the basic principle is the same.  At the time I felt this was my best work but now I feel I have made many more attractive and interesting walkers."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Amoeba_Motor_Contest_Winner"><img src="img/Amoeba_Motor_Contest_Winner.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Amoeba_Motor_Contest_Winner by warptera

This is the trophy model for my Amoeba_Motor_Contest_Thread won by me_myself_and_i.  He really showed his understanding of elliptical amoebas by building his own from scratch using tensions spring spokes.  He beat out a very nice model made by Kevino that is one of my favorites, outside of the contest."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Articulation"><img src="img/Articulation.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Articulation by warptera

Here I used the same programming skills I honed making my wedge motors in a different manner.  The legs actually shrink in size to compensate for the motor's motion.  I like the way it looked with a vestigial set of legs on the top so I left them on the finished piece."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Linear_Hexagonal_Motor"><img src="img/Linear_Hexagonal_Motor.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Linear_Hexagonal_Motor by warptera

Many fine linear combinations have found their way to the zoo.  But I was disappointed that most if not all of them are 3 or 4-sided.  I created this motor out of a desire to make something a little more complicated and visually different.  At the time I did not understand how to make the center masses spin in a larger circle."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Hexagram"><img src="img/Hexagram.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Hexagram by warptera

I wish I had spent more time refining the appearance of this walker that was meant to showcase my new Linear_Hexagonal_Motor.  I think the stride could be made much more efficient and I've never liked those wedge shaped legs."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Robotic_cheekytriangle"><img src="img/Robotic_cheekytriangle.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Robotic_cheekytriangle by warptera

This model uses actuator technology similar to Keystone and Touchstone.  Of course, it is also a tribute to ed's cheekytriangle, one of the twelve original models."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Flourish"><img src="img/Flourish.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Flourish by warptera

This is probably my most deceptively complex model.  Almost every spring is a muscle all programmed to work against each other to varying degrees.  This is the type of model that typically goes unnoticed by all except those who really understand and appreciate the difficulties of actuator programming."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Corsair"><img src="img/Corsair.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Corsair by warptera

This model is like an upright version of Flourish but functions like a biped.  The differing size of the legs makes it a little unstable so I prefer the four-legged version better.  The name comes from an old airplane that has neat bent wings."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+WedgeCrawler"><img src="img/WedgeCrawler.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="WedgeCrawler by warptera

This model is a simplification of one of my very first models.  The only thing I would change is the distortion in the motor caused by the tension spring crown.  Later on I figured out how to program the tension springs to compensate."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Louvre"><img src="img/Louvre.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Louvre by warptera

The motor employed in this model uses two of my regular Linear wedge motors that share one side in common.  The result was a surprisingly fast walker whose general shape reminded me of the pyramid outside the Louvre Museum in Paris, France."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Ether"><img src="img/Ether.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Ether by warptera

This model uses my Linear_Hexagonal_Motor in an inertial setup.  I am not entirely happy with the result, mainly because there is an inconsistency in the motor that I did not notice (or know how to fix anyway) at the time.  If you look carefully, you can see the power points pulse in and out slightly as they travel."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Thrust"><img src="img/Thrust.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Thrust by warptera

Thrust uses the same model as Logos but the result isn't as effective visually.  I felt this model looked like exhaust streaming out of a rocket engine.  I added the leg braces on the bottom as an after thought to stabilize the motion."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Shadow_Ellipses"><img src="img/Shadow_Ellipses.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Shadow_Ellipses by warptera

This model resulted in an experiment where I tried deleting as much as I could from an elliptical amoeba while keeping it operational.  The result looked decent in zero-g and will even reorient itself if you mess it up.  I later found a somewhat similar model in mono's pub."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Rhetoric"><img src="img/Rhetoric.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Rhetoric by warptera

This model also reuses the Logos motor, but this is my least favorite of that bunch.  The problem is that the legs move in a strange elliptical pattern and it forces the models to kick each step it takes."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Glass_Mechanism"><img src="img/Glass_Mechanism.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Glass_Mechanism by warptera

To me this model looks like a glass case like you see in museums.  I like the idea of looking through a transparent panel and seeing all the intricate workings of a model whirring away inside.  Hopefully this effect was successfully conveyed."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Vector_Squared"><img src="img/Vector_Squared.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Vector_Squared by warptera

This model uses a pair of linear combination motors that produce an elliptical counter rotor pattern.  They share one side in common and are braced by a single diagonal spring on each side.  I experimented with many different leg styles and motor configurations before I settled on this version."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Sine_Dragon"><img src="img/Sine_Dragon.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Sine_Dragon by warptera

This is my attempt to revisit the success of Armadillicus with another dramatically articulated snake model.  The structure is surprisingly delicate and each scale can flip around the wrong way if you're not careful.  I thought of adding an additional layer of structure but the construction was already pretty intensive."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Orbit"><img src="img/Orbit.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Orbit by warptera

There is a very nice model in the zoo that is basically a big circle with a round curtain hanging off it of equal diameter.  I forget the name but it creates a very satisfying effect.  I tried to recreate this look using a couple of counter rotors."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Pineapple"><img src="img/Pineapple.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Pineapple by warptera

This walker ended up almost precisely as I intended it to, except for the way the tension springs flex laterally.  It is also one of the only models in my pub that I know of which has a simple programming error I didn't catch before submission. See if you can find it."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Honeycomb"><img src="img/Honeycomb.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Honeycomb by warptera

This model could be much more effective if the motors produced a larger pattern of elliptical motion.  Also I probably should have attached the legs in parallel.  In any case, the pulsing problem in this motor remained unfixed."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Beetle"><img src="img/Beetle.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Beetle by warptera

I finally got around to using my old flex motor with this model.  It uses some scissor structures for legs and it gives the walker a unique appearance."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Tour_de_France"><img src="img/Tour_de_France.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Tour_de_France by warptera

This is one of my best models.  I think it looks particularly good because it mimics something from real life.  The real mechanical triumph is actually the tension spring frame and how the triangle in the center keeps the whole thing up.  I refused to take any shortcuts because I felt it would compromise the effect."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Invisible_Turbine"><img src="img/Invisible_Turbine.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Invisible_Turbine by warptera

This model was a direct result of the work I did with the turbine on Tour_de_France.  In fact, it uses the same flex circles as wheels.  I still am unsure where the odd rocking motion comes from."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Super_Beetle"><img src="img/Super_Beetle.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Super_Beetle by warptera

This model is of course related to Beetle but uses my 4pt_FlexMotor.  In order to sufficiently differentiate it from it's cohort, I made the legs taller and made their structure a little different."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Under_Carriage"><img src="img/Under_Carriage.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Under_Carriage by warptera

This model is one of my most effective walkers using offset timing.  It's lineage goes all the way back to Z_Axis but the overall shape is more pleasing.  Also, the stride pattern it produces is a very flat ellipse and keeps the frame almost perfectly level."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+High_Tower"><img src="img/High_Tower.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="High_Tower by warptera

This model made the jump from Under_Carriage by using false linear motors.  I have continued to use this method of offset timing ever since because it is usually produces very clean and sound walkers.  Some people felt this model wasn't high enough for its name so they built extensions on the top."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Space_Age"><img src="img/Space_Age.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Space_Age by warptera

This model is essentially the same model as High_Tower except with a triangle motif.  The legs are programmed to compensate for the shrinking distance they need to cover as they reach the top of their stride."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Highness"><img src="img/Highness.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Highness by warptera

Highness uses one half of Space_Age upside down to power its array of legs.  I felt that the rotating triangle shapes ended up looking like a crown on the top so that's where the name comes from."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Helix_Walker"><img src="img/Helix_Walker.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Helix_Walker by warptera

I have always felt that helix shapes are among the most 3 dimensional appearing things that can be made in the constructor.  Upon examining them one day I realized that they could easily be used to power legs just like in my Under_Carriage model."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Latch"><img src="img/Latch.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Latch by warptera

This model is unusual because it uses linear motors with center points anchored to a frame.  Normally such motors would just spin around helplessly but the way they are braced keeps them stable."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Modular"><img src="img/Modular.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Modular by warptera

Modular continues the same method as Latch but uses more complicated legs and a much more attractive frame.  I named it Modular because it appears to me that each set of legs and the frame are all separate pieces and could be removed."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Acid_Green"><img src="img/Acid_Green.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Acid_Green by warptera

This is one of those models that would make a great screen saver.  It is centered in the screen and moves in a mesmerizing fashion.  The real trick to making one of these is that it tangles easily without amplitude set at the right amount."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Lattice"><img src="img/Lattice.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Lattice by warptera

Lattice is a very delicate walker but I am very happy with the way it turned out.  On oddity is that because the timing of each muscle that extends the legs is dependant upon the tuning, I had to vary the wave pallet each time I toyed with gravity and friction."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Ultra"><img src="img/Ultra.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Ultra by warptera

I gave Ultra a special name because it was a triumph of programming.  But much like with Flourish, you have to dig deep to see it.  Ultimately, I was a little dissatisfied with the overall aesthetic this model puts forward."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Phaeton"><img src="img/Phaeton.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Phaeton by warptera

This model was named for the child Helios in Greek myth who rode his father's chariot to disaster.  The model's motion is a little chaotic so I felt it matched the turbulent end of its namesake.  But in general it has the appearance of the sun and so belongs to my on going series of that type."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Stylus"><img src="img/Stylus.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Stylus by warptera

This is another highly effective zero-g effect.  I experimented with mirror symmetry and other alternate programming but I like the current version the best."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Stylus_Walker"><img src="img/Stylus_Walker.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Stylus_Walker by warptera

This is related to both Stylus and my Helix_Walker but is heavily modified from the structure and methods of both.  It inadvertently ends up looking most like my old Signature_Walker."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Guideline_Contest_Winner"><img src="img/Guideline_Contest_Winner.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Guideline_Contest_Winner by warptera

This is the trophy model from my Guideline Contest Thread that asked people to build their entries using only zips and lengths equal to a given guideline.  As you can see, lonelyswedish won by designing this great rotating leg walker."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Faberge_Egg"><img src="img/Faberge_Egg.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Faberge_Egg by warptera

This model marks the beginning of an experiment with the offset timing method of joining linear motors that eventually led to the invention of my Rotation Angle Motors.  It is essentially two large amoebas that are connected to each off set by one mass."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Shark_Teeth"><img src="img/Shark_Teeth.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Shark_Teeth by warptera

This model uses a series of six large linear motors that are connected according to the offset timing method.  The way the legs swivel and travel up and down reminds me of how the teeth in the jaws of a shark work."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Optical_Fiber"><img src="img/Optical_Fiber.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Optical_Fiber by warptera

This model is very similar to Faberge_Egg and Shark_Teeth but uses much less wave amplitude than the latter.  I thought it created a nice zero-g 3d effect, but it also functions well as a roller if you increase gravity."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Atomic_Amoeba"><img src="img/Atomic_Amoeba.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Atomic_Amoeba by warptera

This model is a lot like Faberge_Egg but it uses three motors and they are all connected.  If you increase wave amplitude to maximum you will start to see the evolution of the Rotation Angle Motor and the relation to the next model in the series named Anaximander."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Anaximander"><img src="img/Anaximander.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Anaximander by warptera

I named this model after my favorite presocratic philosopher.  The name doesn't have any particular meaning with regard to the structure but it means a lot to me so I saved it for a model I thought was special.  Perhaps you can find the other models named after presocratics in my collection."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Angle_Ellipse_Motors"><img src="img/Angle_Ellipse_Motors.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Angle_Ellipse_Motors by warptera

These motors are the very first Rotation Angle Motors ever made.  I haven't used the hexagon geometry much since then but the principle of how they operate is the same in all RAMs.  These motors happen to produce an elliptical rather than circular path."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Angle_Analysis"><img src="img/Angle_Analysis.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Angle_Analysis by warptera

This model continues my tradition of exploring the walker capabilities of new motors and including the word Analysis in their name.  This model may appear maddeningly complex but the construction methods are actually highly compartmentalized."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Hyacinthus"><img src="img/Hyacinthus.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Hyacinthus by warptera

This model uses one of my Angle_Ellipse_Motors.  It is named for a youth who was struck by one of Apollo's discuses after it was blown off course by the jealous west wind.  This model reminds me of the flower that was named for the mythical figure."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Angle_Ellipse_Box_Motors"><img src="img/Angle_Ellipse_Box_Motors.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Angle_Ellipse_Box_Motors by warptera

These motors use embedded linear motors instead of regular ones.  As a consequence they are left with end points with which to brace them, giving them the appearance of a box.  I also used those extra masses to link these motors together in later models."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Helios"><img src="img/Helios.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Helios by warptera

This is a gigantic and finely crafted Rotation Angle Motor (RAM) and is the best of my sun-based series of models.  Personally I find the motion of these motors to be mesmerizing.  I saved the proper Greek name for the model that I thought deserved it the most."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Ectropy"><img src="img/Ectropy.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Ectropy by warptera

While Entropy refers to increasing chaos, Ectropy refers to increasing order.  While generally, everything slides toward chaos, there are always localized regions of Ectropy, usually near crafty beings like us.  The clockwork appearance of this model makes that point well."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Metazoan"><img src="img/Metazoan.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Metazoan by warptera

This name means to be of a higher order or the result of the highest evolution.  I thought this name was fitting because of how intricate this model's workings are inside.  Perhaps it is a little too delicate though, as it was difficult to tune successfully."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Introvert"><img src="img/Introvert.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Introvert by warptera

This model uses my Angle_Ellipse_Box_Motors in a structure that I saw Kevino use once or twice.  Unfortunately I hadn't quite got the hang of it yet so the proportions and the model's gait are strangely off somehow."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Clover_Cross"><img src="img/Clover_Cross.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Clover_Cross by warptera

Clover_Cross is a Rotation Angle Motor that uses flex circles in place of tension springs.  It should be reminiscent of both my very old CloverStar and its relative Helios."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Crux"><img src="img/Crux.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Crux by warptera

The relative closeness of the wheels in this model makes it want to flip over as it rolls.  I originally had the wheels anchored to tension springs that were on the exact opposite sides of the motor, but it got hung up on the ground so I used a position that is a few degrees off to raise it up."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+4pt_Angle_Counter_Rotor"><img src="img/4pt_Angle_Counter_Rotor.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="4pt_Angle_Counter_Rotor by warptera

The 4pt Rotation Angle Motor is a configuration that I have used extensively since the introduction of this model.  This version uses true linear motors with phased supports but sometimes I use a compound, embedded, or anchored arrangement."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Land_Cruiser"><img src="img/Land_Cruiser.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Land_Cruiser by warptera

This model uses my 4pt_Angle_Counter_Rotor in an inertial setup to drive rotating platforms.  To me it looked like pontoons or the hull of a ship so I gave it a nautical sounding name."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Juxtaposition"><img src="img/Juxtaposition.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Juxtaposition by warptera

The design of this model juxtaposes circle shapes with sharp lines intersecting at right angles.  Also, the legs on one side are offset from the other side to give it a more interesting look."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Photonic"><img src="img/Photonic.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Photonic by warptera

This is the first time I really tried to tackle the style of model pioneered by Jeckyll.  The real trick is to find the lengths necessary to make compound and embedded linear motors whose power points line up over the same distance.  Other than that it just requires patience to construct."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Cyan"><img src="img/Cyan.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Cyan by warptera

Cyan is a model that I was most proud of for a long time, although I have since surpassed it.  To me it is the model that quintessentially defines my style.  It uses a compound linear combination to produce four counter rotors links by tension springs that anchor the legs."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Prowess_JeckyllStyle"><img src="img/Prowess_JeckyllStyle.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Prowess_JeckyllStyle by warptera

Jeckyll has always been known for his fantastic linear combinations but this model is based on his new method of saturation.  In effect it leaves no motor ends hanging of the structure like in some other combinations.  I simply copied his form and linked two structures with a tension spring down the middle."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Thrinax"><img src="img/Thrinax.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Thrinax by warptera

Making a turbine combination is not actually too different from making a linear motor combination once you understand the timing involved.  This model is great because it uses flex circles like gears to increase the advantage of the turbines."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Introspect"><img src="img/Introspect.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Introspect by warptera

This model is very simple in operation and is like many of my mechanical walkers that use offset timing.  I built it because I love the idea of using intricate tension spring frames that leave large open spaces where some sort of structure normally is."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Inscribed"><img src="img/Inscribed.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Inscribed by warptera

This might be my only model that doesn't move whatsoever.  It might be a little difficult to appreciate until you have done a fair bit of constructing yourself, but it is very hard to match the sizes of these complex tension springs and flex shapes.  There is no secret, it just took a lot of trial and error."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Turbox"><img src="img/Turbox.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Turbox by warptera

Turbox is related to Thrinax but each end of the turbines are connected to different size rings and are arranged in a square.  The real problem is programming.  You can't just hook up the turbines, they must all be in the proper phase.  I made several mistakes before I got it right."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Facticity"><img src="img/Facticity.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Facticity by warptera

Like the model, Facticity is a simple sounding philosophical concept but unlike it carries profound implications.  This is a model that I had the idea for the first day I started working with the constructor.  Sadly, I didn't have the skill or understanding at the time to make it so it seems like an anachronism here."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Stilt"><img src="img/Stilt.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Stilt by warptera

About this time I ran into a stagnant period.  Whenever my imagination slows down I like to return to very old structures or delve into the zoo's past.  This resulted in a series of models that use daintywalker style legs to drive longer tension spring legs."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Amper"><img src="img/Amper.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Amper by warptera

Like Stilt, this model resulted from experimenting with relatively ancient structures to get my imagination going again.  I don't know where the name came from other than I thought it sounded interesting.  I suppose the naming process was similar to Antler's as well."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+dirkwalker"><img src="img/dirkwalker.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="dirkwalker by warptera

There are many daintywalker tribute models out there but not many dirkjiggler ones.  This resulted from a challenge in the forum that people make walkers based on the twelve original models.  Of course, I had to construct a new complimentary dirkjiggler to work with the original one."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Combine"><img src="img/Combine.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Combine by warptera

Combining different motor types can sometimes produce hideous looking models.  But teaming these two different rotor types actually turned out okay.  The only main problem is the slight swaying it suffers as it walks."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Machination"><img src="img/Machination.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Machination by warptera

Machination is a philosophical concept put forward by Martin Heidegger in his Beitraege.  This model does its best to portray it by matching four different leg designs to walk in unison.  The result looks a little like Frankenstein's monster, but maybe that's why the concept model idea works so well."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Fusion_of_Horizons"><img src="img/Fusion_of_Horizons.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Fusion_of_Horizons by warptera

This idea came from a philosopher named Hans-Georg Gadamer.  I felt the middle of the structure looked like the wavy reflection that water produces.  It is rare that I would use such a large amount of superfluous structure in a design but it works in this case."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Praxis"><img src="img/Praxis.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Praxis by warptera

Praxis is a Greek word and concept.  The model is actually quite primitive in operation.  However, the legs are made from linear motors so they appear to be shifting their appearance as they move.  I consider this model to be highly visually effective."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Idiom"><img src="img/Idiom.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Idiom by warptera

Idiom is another simple walker related to Praxis.  The neat part is that the three points used to connect all the leg are not actually connected to each other.  This motor structure in the middle is the very first counter rotor stack, although its functionality is not used here."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Peaucellier_Linkage"><img src="img/Peaucellier_Linkage.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Peaucellier_Linkage by warptera

Peaucellier was a French military officer who solved the age-old dilemma of how to construct and anchored, purely geometric linkage that could draw a mathematically straight line.  I worked very hard to make sure that the concept is portrayed flawlessly here."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Peaucellier_Transport"><img src="img/Peaucellier_Transport.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Peaucellier_Transport by warptera

I didn't expect to be able to implement the Peaucellier linkage in a working model when I built it.  However, as with most cases, working with something eventually revealed its secrets to me.  It was a surprising hit and many other constructors found wonderful uses for  the linkage in their own models."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Seafaring"><img src="img/Seafaring.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Seafaring by warptera

This is a relatively straightforward modification of the original daintywalker.  Two things to note are that the leg extensions work in the opposite direction as the legs and that I always construct a new dainty walker from scratch when I make a tribute model."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Q_Type"><img src="img/Q_Type.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Q_Type by warptera

During a time of very low activity qwerty posted a very nice model that used simple triangle to create virtual linear motors from a regular compound linear motor.  The design was ingenious and tons of people submitted models to the zoo in that style.  I named it Q_Type in recognition."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Inside_the_Box"><img src="img/Inside_the_Box.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Inside_the_Box by warptera

One time a new constructor posted that he thought we were all thinking inside the box and we should try harder to make original things.  I felt that such a comment could only come from someone not yet familiar with the task of constructing so I named this model to indicate the advantages of building on the past."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Danube"><img src="img/Danube.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Danube by warptera

The Danube is a river that frequents the imagery of the German poet Hoelderlin.  The name has no particular significance other than the fact that I really wanted to incorporate the impact Hoelderlin's thought has had on my own in a model."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Palimpsest"><img src="img/Palimpsest.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Palimpsest by warptera

This name refers to a very old manuscript that has been scraped and overwritten.  I thought that the flat top of this model combined with the low-slung way it traverses the ground recalls this interesting word."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Exegesis"><img src="img/Exegesis.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Exegesis by warptera

Exegesis is a word having to do with interpreting text so the name is meant to indicate that the model revisits the structure of Palimpsest in a new way.  It also is one of many walkers that I think are two tall for aesthetic and mechanical reasons."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Plate_Tectonics"><img src="img/Plate_Tectonics.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Plate_Tectonics by warptera

Along with Palimpsest and Exegesis, Plate_Techtonics introduced a new type of compound linear motor I call the MultiMotor.  It's basically just a regular compound motor with the corresponding masses zipped together to form 1 or more additional motors.  It looked like a mountain range so I named it after continental drift."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Anaxagoras"><img src="img/Anaxagoras.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Anaxagoras by warptera

Anaxagoras is another presocratic philosopher.  The model uses my Angle_Ellipse_Box_Motors joined by exact tension springs.  I decided to use only half of the available power points because I thought it would have an unseal look to it."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Dachshund"><img src="img/Dachshund.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Dachshund by warptera

This model uses a combination of technologies to achieve its low-slung appearance.  I internationally made it very long to prevent it from tipping as it walked.  Playing with wave amplitude will change the dimensions and stride in interesting ways."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Polis"><img src="img/Polis.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Polis by warptera

Named after the Greek word for a city, Polis uses compound motors and actuators just like Dachshund to propel itself forward.  Notice that the vertically oscillating masses connected to the lower structure do not need to be there.  I could have used a different kind of actuator to eliminate them."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Duck_Walk"><img src="img/Duck_Walk.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Duck_Walk by warptera

This model uses a combination of my MultiMotor method and a novel idea by a constructor named the_duck.  He came up with the idea of using the zip spring structure called a Pandora as expandable legs.  I believe that Pandoras were originally created by Qwerty."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+The_Maltese_Falcon"><img src="img/The_Maltese_Falcon.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="The_Maltese_Falcon by warptera

This model, named after the classic Film Noir, is very similar to my Inside_the_Box and Danube models.  I didn't set out that make a model that looked like anything in particular but as the shape emerged I felt it might be appropriate to steer it in that direction."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Tmesis"><img src="img/Tmesis.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Tmesis by warptera

Tmesis comes from a Greek word that refers to a specific grammatical or rhetorical device.  Basically it uses two boxed Rotation Angle Motors linked by a tension spring.  It actually has a difficult time rolling forward because of the square wheels but it's that a little tuning can't conquer."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Predator_and_Prey"><img src="img/Predator_and_Prey.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Predator_and_Prey by warptera

I don't remember exactly how this model became two models.  But I think it's funny that although I intended it to be obvious which one was the predator and which was the prey, they actually take turns chasing each other."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Empedocles"><img src="img/Empedocles.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Empedocles by warptera

If you know the story of Empedocles, you'll know what I mean when I say that this model originally reminded me of a volcano.  I love those robots that scientists use to explore volcanic craters and this model looks like it could carry a payload of instruments into those harsh environments."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Chiron"><img src="img/Chiron.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Chiron by warptera

I wasn't sure what to think of this model when it was first made.  I actually had several different versions going at once and there was no clear winner.  This version has really grown on me since, however.  It is named for the wise centaur who tutored Achilles and Hercules."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Invisible_RAM"><img src="img/Invisible_RAM.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Invisible_RAM by warptera

This model originally consisted of two 1pt Rotation Angle Motors joined by the power points in the center of their tension springs.  But the actuators unexpectedly lined up perfectly so I rebuilt so they shared the end points in common and deleted the tension springs entirely."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Tick_Tock"><img src="img/Tick_Tock.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Tick_Tock by warptera

Tick_Tock developed from a method I discovered to capture bent flex shapes.  The odd reciprocating action is brought about inertially.  You can get a better idea of how it works if you tag one of the flex masses with a spring and watch how it moves in a strangely elliptical pattern."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Terra_Firma"><img src="img/Terra_Firma.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Terra_Firma by warptera

Making Empedocles got me thinking about unmanned reconnaissance machines and it made me want to more accurately recreate their appearance.  This model uses actuators as legs and linear motors to drive the satellite dish up and down to send and receive signals."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Muse"><img src="img/Muse.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Muse by warptera

This model uses the same method as Tick_Tock to capture bent flex shapes, but uses two instead of one.  The elliptical pattern in which certain masses move allows me to use them to drive the legs of this walker.  Unfortunately, the stride pattern is a little awkward."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Grammar"><img src="img/Grammar.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Grammar by warptera

This model uses bent flex shapes much like my BlueCube_KevinoStyle but they are links and to it rolls rather than functions as an amoeba, a subtle difference.  The name is in reference to a model named Tmesis whose appearance it shares."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+RAM_Analysis"><img src="img/RAM_Analysis.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="RAM_Analysis by warptera

I like the look of this Rotation Angle Motor walker quite a bit.  I think it is because the spinning tension springs appear to be floating inside of a cage formed by the motor braces."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Spires"><img src="img/Spires.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Spires by warptera

This model uses anchored linear motors braced together with a RAM configuration in between them.  The leg design is one of two possible simple tension spring configurations.  The ends of the linear motors serve as pivots for the leg joints and sway nicely as it walks forward and back."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+One_Cylinder"><img src="img/One_Cylinder.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="One_Cylinder by warptera

Just for fun one day I showed a 1pt rotary motor to people in the forum and asked if anyone could do anything with it.  This model was my first attempt and many other people can up with even more creative ideas.  Lonelyswedish built an especially nice walker with it."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+reklawytniad"><img src="img/reklawytniad.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="reklawytniad by warptera

This model's name is daintywalker spelled backwards.  This is because I built a frame that looks like a daintywalker turned inside out.  I like using complex frames to call attention to otherwise obscure parts.  I hope it calls attention to how the legs work so people can learn to make their own."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+daintyabstract"><img src="img/daintyabstract.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="daintyabstract by warptera

This is another daintywalker tribute model and is perhaps the best one I've done.  I like how it looks almost exactly like daintywalker when the wave amplitude is set to minimum.  But when it is raised the frame splits apart and it walks in an unexpected fashion."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Rhodon"><img src="img/Rhodon.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Rhodon by warptera

Rhodon is an Ancient Greek word for rose.  The design is an elaboration of a type of linkage that Jeckyll worked with quite a bit.  I adapted it for my own use by adding two extra layers of depth and setting it up as a zero friction model, a technique I learned from Lectvay."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Annuit_Coeptis"><img src="img/Annuit_Coeptis.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Annuit_Coeptis by warptera

This model uses a mechanism similar to One_Cylinder.  If you don't know what the design means just get a US one dollar bill and flip it over.  The phrase is Latin, and along with the imagery, recalls the old days of free masonry and its influence on our founding fathers."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+ATD"><img src="img/ATD.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="ATD by warptera

This model is relatively straightforward.  It is a daintywalker tribute model constructed from scratch.  Tension springs that link each center point of the elliptical amoeba provide a base for each leg.  Tuning was more challenging than I expected because the amoebas just wanted to spin around."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Fiocchi_di_Neve"><img src="img/Fiocchi_di_Neve.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Fiocchi_di_Neve by warptera

I got the idea for this model by looking through some of Jeckyll's unfinished work he had abandoned.  I chose a type of wheel I've never used before and named it the Italian word for snowflake as a thinly veiled acknowledgement of its undoubted origin."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+The_Maltese_Cross"><img src="img/The_Maltese_Cross.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="The_Maltese_Cross by warptera

This model is unusual because it relies on a distortion of the frame geometry to move forward the way it does.  Normally I go to extreme lengths to avoid such bending and twisting but I ended up liking the way it appeared to snap into position."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Sirius"><img src="img/Sirius.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Sirius by warptera

Sirius is the dog star.  The linear combinations are unusual because they are not real 4pt linear motors.  If you look closely they are missing one spring and are actually programmed like two joined 3pt motors.  I learned how to make it from one of Jeckyll's models."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Necessity"><img src="img/Necessity.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Necessity by warptera

The title of this model comes from a line delivered in Aeschylus' "Prometheus Bound".  The circular structure is surprisingly rigid but to find out exactly what it is stronger than you'll have to read the play."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Charybdis"><img src="img/Charybdis.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Charybdis by warptera

Charybdis is a whirlpool that lies across from the monster Scylla.  The motor used here is similar to a Counter Rotor Stack but is actually a stack of two linear combinations that produce the same effect."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Quiesce"><img src="img/Quiesce.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Quiesce by warptera

This name means to become quiet, which I thought was appropriate for this large but hollow and soft-stepping walker.  Jeckyll influenced the ring shaped motor although I built it from scratch."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Zero_Friction_RAM"><img src="img/Zero_Friction_RAM.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Zero_Friction_RAM by warptera

This is just an oversized zero friction example of how to make a 4pt RAM linkage.  It also spins inertially if you look closely.  Also note that any properly sized 4 pt linear motor can power the linkage as well, eliminating the need for the usual dual motors."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Gamma"><img src="img/Gamma.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Gamma by warptera

Here is a textbook use for RAM linkages.  Each one is built to exact specifications so the right size tension spring fits properly into each set to make contact with the ground.  I experimented with many different kinds of diagonal linkage and settled on the current version because it was the most attractive."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Stalactites"><img src="img/Stalactites.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Stalactites by warptera

Stalactites are natural cave formations that hang from the ceilings.  The motor operates inertially and is a specialized version of a 4pt RAM.  It uses an additional pair of linear motors that are slightly out of phase with the first two so they occupy the space in between."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Deciduous"><img src="img/Deciduous.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Deciduous by warptera

This model looks like a pinecone to me.  It is similar to the gigantic RAM I used in Helios and other models except instead of tension springs it uses huge triangles to produce elliptical motion."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Quadriceps"><img src="img/Quadriceps.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Quadriceps by warptera

I didn't even realize it until I was finished and it was time to pick a name that this model only uses four muscles.  It has a single 4pt linear compound linear motor and the three linkages and connecting rods do the rest of the work."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Sisyphus"><img src="img/Sisyphus.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Sisyphus by warptera

This model is named for the great tragic figure of Greek myth.  Sisyphus only had to push one boulder up a hill for eternity but this motor has two boulders to contend with.  I like the design of the wheels a lot and this was the first time I used them."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Newtonian_Time"><img src="img/Newtonian_Time.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Newtonian_Time by warptera

This model begins not only my best series of models, but also perhaps my best models period.  The counter rotor stack multiples the wave pallet so the minute hand can run at twelve times the rate of the hour hand."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Einsteinian_Time"><img src="img/Einsteinian_Time.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Einsteinian_Time by warptera

I had multiple iterations of this model going at once.  Relativity is a difficult concept to present visually so I decided that showing the curvature of space-time would be the most effective.  Ironically, this is most foreign to our everyday concept of time."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Phenomenological_Time"><img src="img/Phenomenological_Time.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Phenomenological_Time by warptera

This model is very subtle.  It is meant to make the viewer understand how human our experience of the passage of time really is.  This concept stands is stark contrast with the first two intellectual understandings of time that are just abstractions of our true experience."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Into_the_Looking_Glass"><img src="img/Into_the_Looking_Glass.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Into_the_Looking_Glass by warptera

It is impossible for me to follow models like my time series with anything that won't get over shadowed.  As a result I decided to do something fun and as an experiment, I tried to replicate the appearance of the constructor interface using fixed and free masses."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Indigo"><img src="img/Indigo.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Indigo by warptera

This model is essentially the same model as High_Tower except the motor braces themselves are programmed.  It is a process called skewing that shifts the motors to a degree dependant on the relative amplitude of the brace programming."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Totum"><img src="img/Totum.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Totum by warptera

This model uses linear motor combinations, a compound MultiMotor, linear motor bracing, and tension spring legs to achieve forward progress.  For some reason I was thinking of a totem pole or other American Indian artifacts when I was making this."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Splay"><img src="img/Splay.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Splay by warptera

To splay means to spread and that is appropriate for this model whose principle functionality is close to Dachshund's.  The real trick was to find the right relative amplitude, and hence the right bracing angle, to keep the motors perfectly parallel and undistorted."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Tangent"><img src="img/Tangent.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Tangent by warptera

This model uses skewed motor bracing just like most of the models from this period.  I have no idea why I named it Tangent, I guess I just always liked that word.  Strangely, this is one of the few times I've used anchored linear motors."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Inertia"><img src="img/Inertia.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Inertia by warptera

I like this model quite a bit because it demonstrates how durable and quick RAM linkages can be.  Of course, you must use the highest level of craftsmanship because any inaccurate lengths can throw a monkey wrench into the whole thing."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Overkill"><img src="img/Overkill.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Overkill by warptera

I'm not sure if people really understood this model.  Basically it converts the linear motion from MultiMotors into rotary motion via the RAM linkages, then converts it back to linear motion by removing the vertical component with actuators.  Then the legs are hooked up to regain elliptical motion."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Cotangent"><img src="img/Cotangent.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Cotangent by warptera

Cotangent is a relative of Tangent.  I don't like the motor as much but the leg design makes it a much better model overall.  And just like Splay, it required finding the right relative amplitude to avoid distorting the motors."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Method"><img src="img/Method.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Method by warptera

The name Method is rather plain but I thought of it while reading Hans-Georg Gadamer's "Truth & Method".  It has 3pt RAM linkages and tension springs legs.  But I don't particularly like the swaying motion because it results from each set of legs being out of phase with each other."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Palindrome"><img src="img/Palindrome.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Palindrome by warptera

While this model looks like two simple linked walkers, try picking it up or decreasing gravity.  It is the program timing that keeps them anchored to each other in such a rigid fashion."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Centric"><img src="img/Centric.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Centric by warptera

Lectvay pioneered zero friction models, but I try my hand at them every once in a while if I can think of a good enough idea.  This model used two concentric flex circles as mass placement guides that were deleted prior to submission."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Strobe"><img src="img/Strobe.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Strobe by warptera

This model used the same flex ring template as Centric.  I don't think it produces as nice an effect but it certainly is hypnotizing if you stare into long enough."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Omnibus"><img src="img/Omnibus.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Omnibus by warptera

One thing I found while practicing skewed motor braces is that they keep such perfect mass placement that sometimes you don't even need the other motor.  The only disappointing thing about this otherwise fine walker is that the same thing could be achieved much easier with simple triangles."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Svensk"><img src="img/Svensk.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Svensk by warptera

I always really like lonelyswedish's winning model in my guideline contest.  I decided to continue the idea without the limitations of the contest and came up with this model.  Incidentally, Sevens is Swedish for Swedish."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Wavino"><img src="img/Wavino.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Wavino by warptera

This is a huge elaboration upon a model I saw in Kevino's pub.  I named it Wavino in attempt to make a clever reference to the person who inspired it.  While it may look like a predecessor to my America model, that work started way back around model number 129."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Viscosity"><img src="img/Viscosity.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Viscosity by warptera

I don't have any particular reason why I named this model Viscosity, but I suppose it looks a little like a pool of molasses flowing slowly across the floor.  I saved time by scavenging part of my own Wavino for the construction."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+daintyescher"><img src="img/daintyescher.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="daintyescher by warptera

The motor in the center of this model was submitted to the zoo one day under the name Escher's Pillar.  I immediately put it to work in a walker but in retrospect I think the way I assembled it made the stride too large.  As such it needed very little gravity to avoid being squashed mid-stride."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+daintylinkage"><img src="img/daintylinkage.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="daintylinkage by warptera

This model presented me with a dilemma.  I usually make my daintywalker tribute models with the same leg timing as the original.  But the center of this model looked awfully funny that way so I switched it.  The result looked like a geometric abstract painting to me prompting me to name it so."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Minutia"><img src="img/Minutia.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Minutia by warptera

Minutia gets away with the leg timing scheme that daintylinkage could not pull off.  It succeeds because each side only drives one set of legs rather than both.  This avoids the ugly cluttered problem discussed in the prior model."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Cyanic"><img src="img/Cyanic.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Cyanic by warptera

Cyanic is related to Cyan of course.  It uses a MultiMotor combination but I don't think it is as effective visually as its processor or some later models of this type."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Magenta"><img src="img/Magenta.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Magenta by warptera

This is my favorite model.  I love how the legs attach to hubless wheels.  I can't wait until the sodarace architecture is finished so I can see how this complicated but robust mechanism handles terrain.  I also wonder how fast it can go because it was hitting the walls that really limited the tuning."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Porsche_Speedster"><img src="img/Porsche_Speedster.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Porsche_Speedster by warptera

The old Porsche Speedster is one of my favorite cars ever.  I really like its shapely fenders and the ridiculously low-slung windshield.  Unfortunately, I could not find a graceful way to support the flex body panels in my version so it has a crosshatched look to it."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Hubcaps"><img src="img/Hubcaps.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Hubcaps by warptera

This model uses the same wheels as Magenta and Porsche_Speedster because I liked the proportions very much.  This simple compound linear combination is straight forward, but I like the effect of having the hubcaps spin in the opposite direction as the wheels."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Spheric"><img src="img/Spheric.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Spheric by warptera

This is an inertially motivated rolling model.  It is powered by a linear combination with attachments so it functions like a Rotation Angle Motor.  It originally had zip spring streamers hanging off the motor but I deleted them because it didn't fit in with the character of my other models."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Architype"><img src="img/Architype.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Architype by warptera

This too uses the same wheels as Magenta.  And like Palidrome, the program timing keeps the structure rigid even though it looks like it is just hinged.  It took a little while to find the right length tension springs so the rotors would look right if I remember correctly."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+America"><img src="img/America.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="America by warptera

This model took me far longer than any other to finish.  It was so time consuming to construct and program that I just worked on it little by little over a few months.  I might never have finished it if I hadn't wanted to get it out before the start of the Iraq war to show support for my country."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Kiloton"><img src="img/Kiloton.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Kiloton by warptera

Kiloton has the same linear motor combination with RAM modifications as Spheric.  It walks okay but has the same general problem as Muse does in that the stride is a little awkward.  I think smaller motors or more space between them would've made it better."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Regent"><img src="img/Regent.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Regent by warptera

To my surprise, many people really enjoyed this model.  It uses simple offset timing like many of my walkers, however the round legs give it an interesting look as it walks.  Not surprising is that it has been confused with the similar looking model Hubcaps even though they share nothing else in common."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Half_Rotors"><img src="img/Half_Rotors.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Half_Rotors by warptera

One day I was fiddling around with some rotor designs and I wondered if a suitably reinforced linkage could be made into a 4pt rotor with only half the usual muscles.  It turns out that it could be made and this walker is the first result.  And the wave pallet looks highly unusual for a walker."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Drivetrain"><img src="img/Drivetrain.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Drivetrain by warptera

This is another idea that I had from the beginning but forgot about because I didn't have the required expertise at the time.  It operates inertially and uses the same motor as Stalactites.  My only regret is not using higher quality wheels because these ones seem reluctant to roll."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Dos_Equis"><img src="img/Dos_Equis.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Dos_Equis by warptera

This model was built with virtually no overriding direction.  I was just kind of constructing for fun and by the time I knew what I was doing I had made a nearly working concept.  It just goes to show you how important the act of constructing is to the finished appearance of your models."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Motive"><img src="img/Motive.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Motive by warptera

Motive uses the same principle as Half_Rotors.  I also choose the same basic wheel design first used in Sisyphus.  I don't know if there is even a name for them yet.  I didn't invent them but they always remind me of a woven basket."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+HobGoblin_JeckyllStyle"><img src="img/HobGoblin_JeckyllStyle.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="HobGoblin_JeckyllStyle by warptera

One morning I saw a model in the zoo by Jeckyll.  I immediately recognized that 3pt linear motors could be employed to power the mechanism so I deleted his motor and tried adding the current ones.  It works basically the same way so I submitted it right away and credited Jeckyll."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Crete"><img src="img/Crete.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Crete by warptera

Sometimes a model has just the right dimensions without you even having to try.  In this case it just seemed that every decision I made regarding length and proportions worked out.  I named it for an island south of Greece that I have always wanted to visit."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Minos"><img src="img/Minos.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Minos by warptera

The technology employed by Minos is related to Crete.  I named it after the ancient king of that island who used to demand the sacrifice of young Athenians."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Minotaur"><img src="img/Minotaur.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Minotaur by warptera

The Minotaur was the monster that Minos, king of Crete, had in his labyrinth.  The odd elliptical pattern produced by these cone shaped linear combinations is slightly squashed so the walker tends to sway back and forth as it moves, giving it an eerie frankenstein gait."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Theseus"><img src="img/Theseus.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Theseus by warptera

Theseus was the hero who slew the Minotaur and ended the ritual sacrifices.  He also appears in Sophocles' "Oedipus at Colonus," one of my favorite plays.  The leg design and motor usage of both Crete and Theseus make them two of my best walkers."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Perspective"><img src="img/Perspective.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Perspective by warptera

This model uses the skew programming technique to bend or warp the cone linear combinations.  I named it Perspective because of the lines that meet at the center points look like a road that disappears over the horizon."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Man_of_War"><img src="img/Man_of_War.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Man_of_War by warptera

Man_of_War uses the skew programming technique.  It also has legs like both Crete and Theseus but they cross at the center.  The result produced a surprising stable walker with a very smooth stride.  I named it after the poisonous jellyfish that shares its basic shape."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Achilles"><img src="img/Achilles.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Achilles by warptera

Achilles uses RAM linkages in place of Crete's and Theseus' cone linears and elliptical amoebas.  But I think it doesn't look as good as those two because the motor is too large and the legs are proportioned wrong."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Zenith"><img src="img/Zenith.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Zenith by warptera

This model took a lot of patience to program.  The relative amplitude needed to be just right to get the rotary portion of the motors to line up correctly.  I like it a lot because it has an asymmetric frame yet still produces a nice walking machine."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Curie"><img src="img/Curie.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Curie by warptera

Curie was meant to imitate lonelyswedish's style of intricate four-legged walker, but something went awry because it is too symmetrical and the toes recall my own Radiance model.  I named it after Pierre Curie in a veiled reference to that model's radioactive name."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Waver"><img src="img/Waver.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Waver by warptera

This model uses 2pt compound linear motors and is related in structure to Minotaur.  In fact, it suffered the same swaying motion but to a much larger degree.  Because of this, I tuned it to exaggerate the effect and named it for this property."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Gutenberg"><img src="img/Gutenberg.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Gutenberg by warptera

This model uses 2pt compound linear motors and vaguely recalls Danube although it has fewer legs.  I decided to call it Gutenberg after the man who invented the printing press, making so much learning and progress both possible and accessible."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Sway"><img src="img/Sway.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Sway by warptera

Sway is like both Minotaur and Waver, but it uses linear actuators instead of cone linear combinations.  As a result it has the same funny squashed ellipse pattern but it is reversed.  In retrospect I should have lover the relative amplitude of the compound linear motor to reduce the swaying."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Rotato"><img src="img/Rotato.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Rotato by warptera

I got the idea for Rotato from some of Jeckyll's models.  The leg motion is actually very similar to Antler in that each set of legs swings up and over the frame before coming back down to take its turn carrying the load."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Fist"><img src="img/Fist.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Fist by warptera

Fist is my second attempt to mimic the style of lonelyswedish.  I think it was more successful than Curie but I doubt anyone actually mistook it for one of his models.  I don't know what it is but lonelyswedish is difficult to imitate."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Differential"><img src="img/Differential.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Differential by warptera

This is the simple model I am most proud of.  Probably because it marks the invention of my phased compound motors.  Using these techniques you can create compound motors where the ends are no longer mirror images of each other.  It can get complex but amazing things are possible."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Triceps"><img src="img/Triceps.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Triceps by warptera

Using 3pt Phased Compound Motors I was finally able to construct the model I had in mind when I built Method.  It looks similar to Quadriceps so I named it in kind but the structures are actually very different."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Interconnectedness"><img src="img/Interconnectedness.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Interconnectedness by warptera

Interconnectedness is my version of some 2pt linear combinations that Jeckyll started working with.  It required intense guideline and programming work but the result is one of my most complex and beautiful models."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Bow_Tie"><img src="img/Bow_Tie.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Bow_Tie by warptera

This uses a 3-sided 2pt compound linear combination that combines compound linear motors and MultiMotors.  The main portion was actually excerpted from Interconnectedness to save time in construction."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Conservation"><img src="img/Conservation.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Conservation by warptera

This zero-g/zero-f model demonstrates the conservation of angular momentum.  It took many tries to get it jump started without too much vibration.  Sometimes I imagine viewing a figure skater from above doing one of those spins when I look at it."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Winch"><img src="img/Winch.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Winch by warptera

Winch is a combination of 2pt compound motors that makes a series of 1pt RAMs with center points.  I then connected a tension spring to the center point and the power point to yield another usable power point to connect the legs."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+King_Crab"><img src="img/King_Crab.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="King_Crab by warptera

King_Crab uses 2pt Phased Compound Motors to drive a counter rotor linkage in the bottom.  Then I hit upon the idea of using 4pt anchored linear motors to brace the tops of the 2pt ones, then I used the anchor points to mount the legs onto."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Compensation"><img src="img/Compensation.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Compensation by warptera

It might not be evident, but Compensation uses different length actuators to reproduce the same stride pattern.  The trick is to program them experimentally to cover the same distance, which requires adjusting the relative amplitude."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Overwhelm"><img src="img/Overwhelm.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Overwhelm by warptera

Overwhelm is related to Overkill in principle.  It uses linear actuators to drive rotors but simultaneously cancels out one component of their elliptical motion.  Then I used the resulting 3pt linear configurations to drive a conventional offset group of legs."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Spectacles"><img src="img/Spectacles.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Spectacles by warptera

Spectacles is a great looking walker and reminds me of lonelyswedish's winning entry in the guideline contest and my own Svensk.  It also contains one of the most complex motors I have even made, although you could never tell from its one-dimensional appearance."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Switcharoo"><img src="img/Switcharoo.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Switcharoo by warptera

Switcharoo combines linear and rotary motor power into a very smooth walker.  But in actuality the rotary motion is provided first from the compound linear motor anyway.  I named it how I did because it looked like a mechanical or electrical switch to me."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Spectral"><img src="img/Spectral.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Spectral by warptera

Spectral is based on a fine model by Jeckyll that looked like an orange slice.  I built on the principle by adding the mechanism to the aesthetic of Svensk and Spectacles."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Spokes"><img src="img/Spokes.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Spokes by warptera

Spokes was a real pain to construct and program because each actuator was connected at acute angles to other actuators.  Also, all the wheels overlapped each other.  The only good thing about it was that if I made any programming errors they were immediately evident in simulate mode."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+X_Ray"><img src="img/X_Ray.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="X_Ray by warptera

One genre I rarely mess around with is bipeds.  I do enjoy them very much though so every once in a while I like to try and make them.  I am proud of this one because it looks and moves very different from anything else in my pub."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Beamer"><img src="img/Beamer.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Beamer by warptera

My account takes quite along time to load because of all the models in it. For this reason I have a secret account which I use for models in progress.  Unfortunately I forgot this model was in there for about a month so it is a bit of an anachronism."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Equal_Scales"><img src="img/Equal_Scales.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Equal_Scales by warptera

I had the idea for a snake like this during the design of Armadillicus, but I had no idea how to build it.  Since things got a little slow I revisited the old idea and made two models based on what I have learned since about actuator programming."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Olde"><img src="img/Olde.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Olde by warptera

Olde is very similar to Spokes but each wheel contains two sets of points that are 60 degrees off from each other.  For this reason, three identical wheels interlock and spin around each other.  It also rotates inertially but it is hard to tell how much because of how busy the mechanism is."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=warptera+Diamond_Scales"><img src="img/Diamond_Scales.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Diamond_Scales by warptera

Diamond_Scales was constructed almost immediately after Equal_Scales but required a lot of extra structure and reprogramming.  In retrospect I wish I had made it in miniature sot it had to make more undulations to go back and forth across the constructor window."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=mono+soft_lines"><img src="img/soft_lines.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="soft_lines by mono

This is one of the best examples of how organic flex structures can appear. Even the programming animates this shape in a lively way. It is a testament to life that something so formless and asymmetrical can be so beautiful. I imagine that it is a protein or DNA sequence replicating itself."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=Lectvay+AccordianStyle"><img src="img/AccordianStyle.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="AccordianStyle by Lectvay

Lectvay worked quite hard, experimenting with different structures and supports, to give this model its appearance. The result looks very menacing and is just fantastic. Notice that instead of internal braces, regular springs at the end of each leg keep the whole structure rigid."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=lonelyswedish+biped_study_06"><img src="img/biped_study_06.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="biped_study_06 by lonelyswedish

While lonelyswedish is known for his intricate 4 legged walkers, this simple and elegant biped really caught my eye. It moves in a manner that I wouldn't have thought possible. To have designed a biped like this shows great versatility because its so different from his other work."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=Jeckyll+Burning_the_ground"><img src="img/Burning_the_ground.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="Burning_the_ground by Jeckyll

Every once in a while, you click on one of those zoo icons and a model appears that is so good it hurts. This is one of them. Everything about this model, its style, construction, programming, sheer mass, is daunting. It's best not to think about how he did it, just enjoy it."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=mono+triplehelix"><img src="img/triplehelix.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="triplehelix by mono

The complexity of this model's construction and programming was incomprehensible to me when I first encountered it. I particularly like how it seems 3 dimensional. One interesting feature is that its program divides the wave pallet into ninths, which is very rare."></a><a href="http://sodaplay.com/constructor/player.htm?&getmodel=Kevino+TriangleQ"><img src="img/TriangleQ.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="TriangleQ by Kevino

This model really blew me away when I first saw it. It introduced me to flex structures and required me to develop dissection skills to understand it. I made a series of models in tribute and credited Kevino in each of their names, but none equal the original's geometric simplicity."></a></div>
