Here are some of the common questions people ask me about my models and techniques.  If you have a question you can ask me in conversation at the soda forum or goto the 'contact' section of this site and email me.
<br>
<br>
<b>Q:</b> Can you help me with my model?
<br>
<br>
<b>A:</b> Sure, but I am just one member of a larger community.  There are many poeple who visit sodaplay, some of whom are experts in techniques I know nothing about.  So please take advantage of the 'Dedicated Help Thread' in the sodaforum.  It is a place where you can get your questions answered as quickly as possible by whomever can offer assitance, plus it conserves board space by relieving the need for individual topics.  Just preview your model link to be sure people can see it, and try to ask specific questions so people get the best idea of what you need.
<br>
<br>
<b>Q:</b> When will the 'tutorial' section of this site be opened?
<br>
<br>
<b>A:</b> Putting up this site was alot of work, so I will need to take a break for a little bit after it goes live.  However, the tutorial is almost completely written.  Some of it will be made obsolete when the upgraded sodaconstructor applet arrives so I plan to wait until then before converting the whole thing to html and adding new picture links.  It will also be available for download in text, word document formats.
<br>
<br>
<b>Q:</b> How did you make that model?
<br>
<br>
<b>A:</b> I don't have enough time to explain in detail the workings of every model to everyone that asks.  Besides, if you take the time to dissect and learn about one of my models you will increase your understanding and be able to make your own models.  I learned by dissecting models from the zoo and great constructors like Kevino and especially mono, and you can too.  Believe me you can teach youself better than I can, plus you'll have the satisfaction of crafting your own unique understanding.
<br>
<br>
<b>Q:</b>  How long does it take to make your models?
<br>
<br>
<b>A:</b> It varies from model to model based on their complexity.  Another factor is the quality of my understanding of the techniques required.  Sometimes I can make a complex model relatively quickly, but only because I took a really long time learning the technique while making an earlier model.  I can't put enough stress on how important it is to avoid shortcuts.  If you take the time to nurture a genuine and complete understanding of a principle, you will never have to do it again because it will be reinforced each time you exercise it.
<br>
<br>
<b>Q:</b> Do you do anything besides making models?
<br>
<br>
<b>A:</b> Yes I do.  You may even be able to get an idea of my interests outside sodaplay by looking through my models.  Things I read or am interested in often inspire their structures and names.  In case you didn't notice, many are influenced by greek and german philosophy.  I am also captivated by complex machinery, automobiles, and electrical systems.  One other thing I do is work out religiously, and now that I think about it, there are lots of interesting mechanical hinges, levers, and linkages at the gym too.
